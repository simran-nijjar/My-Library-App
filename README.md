# My Library App

My Library App is a full-stack library application created using React for the front-end and Node.js and Express.js for the back-end, integrated with a MySQL database.
The library is made using books using the Google Books API. Users can search for books, write reviews and give ratings to books, and view reviews written by other users. 
User authentication was developed using JWT tokens and session state using localStorage.
